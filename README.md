### 👋 Hi, I’m Ludovic NDI

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on**  
  Secure IoT systems, full-stack web platforms, and cloud-connected architectures with a strong focus on reliability, scalability, and security-by-design. I actively build and experiment with embedded systems (ESP32, Arduino) and backend services used in real-world contexts.

- 🌱 **I’m currently learning**  
  Advanced cybersecurity practices, secure system architecture, threat modeling, and defensive strategies applied to IoT, web, and cloud environments. I am also deepening my understanding of AI-driven systems and their infrastructure.

- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on**  
  Open-source projects related to IoT, embedded systems, cybersecurity, distributed systems, and applied AI—especially projects with real-world impact and strong engineering standards.

- 🤔 **I’m looking for help with**  
  Contributing to large-scale open-source codebases, improving system-level performance, and collaborating with research-oriented teams working on AI, security, or infrastructure challenges.

- 💬 **Ask me about**  
  IoT architecture, embedded systems, full-stack development, cybersecurity fundamentals, secure system design, and technical education.

- 📫 **How to reach me:**  
  GitHub Issues / Discussions, LinkedIn, or email (available upon request).

- 😄 **Pronouns:**  
  He / Him

- ⚡ **Fun fact:**  
  When I start working on a technical problem, I often lose track of time—debugging, optimizing, and securing systems feels more like a passion than work.
